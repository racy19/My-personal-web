I use the <strong>Node.js</strong> framework and the <strong>React</strong> library. For styling the presentation part of the website, I use <strong>Bootstrap</strong>. I have previously been introduced to the <strong>WordPress</strong> content management system and creating custom themes.</p><p>Besides programming, I enjoy going to nature and also exploring Czechoslovakian fortifications. One representative can be seen here in the picture :)</p>",
